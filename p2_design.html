			<h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2>
			<p>The goal of the website is to reach out to new and old members, to provide information on upcoming events, 
			movie screenings, how to contact administration and important information regarding membership pricing.</p>

			<h2>Navigation structure</h2>
			<p>The navigation structure of the website will be designed so that every page can be reached from every page. We will do this with a navigation bar. We also plan on using roll-over menus for easy access to sub-pages.
			This can be described as clique structure. The only exception to this will be on the page regarding movie screenings where the
			user can access links that direct to other websites that contain additional information about each movie, such as movie trailers and movie summaries.
			Such as the specific movie's IMDB or FilmWeb page.</p>
			<p>Our reasoning behind this structure is that the users has freedom to navigate the site as they choose, it also makes it easy to see the structure of the website. User friendly design is the foremost reasoning behind our choices.</p>
